# Personas and Scenarios 
## Introduction 
The purpose of UX Storytelling is so that we can understand how different users operate, so as UI/UX designers and researchers, we can create and build interfaces, systems, and products that cater to target users' feelings and expectations. UX Storytelling helps those who are in the UI/UX field to make people's lives easier, more efficient, and effective. UX Storytelling helps us brainstorm, plan, and come up with better ideas as we begin to understand our users more accurately on a personal level. From extensive research, we are able to predict target users' responses more accurately by generating design ideas and building prototypes to test these ideas.

Sean is working for the third time in a row this week while his friends are going to a music concert tonight. He really wanted to go but he was scheduled to work night shift. Knowing that his friends would have the time of their lives while he would be working late again made him feel left out. 
Live shows are something that Sean really enjoys going to so he feels more alone and frustrated than usual. He feels like his social life is non-existent because most of the time when his friends ask him to hang out, he can’t because of his commitment to work or his internship. He wishes he could befriend people like him who share the same struggles but also share the same taste for music.
After Sean goes back home, he showers and hops on his bed. He knew the perfect app to go on to talk to others about this. He opens the app and taps on the "Home button" and posts "Anyone else miss out on the concert tonight?" People commented below in a few minutes. A girl commented “I couldn't! Had to work tonight. Such a bummer." Curious, he taps on her name, which leads to her profile. He looks at her posts and replies and the artists that she follows. She seemed cool and liked similar artists. He taps the "Add" button under her bio. She accepts his request a few minutes later and he taps the chat box at the bottom. “Hey! Seems like we're on the same boat. Want to have a little pity party for ourselves?” She responded "I totally get it. It's nice to know I'm not the only one."
