# Personas and Scenarios 
## Introduction 
The purpose of UX Storytelling is so that we can understand how different users operate, so as UI/UX designers and researchers, we can create and build interfaces, systems, and products that cater to target users' feelings and expectations. UX Storytelling helps those who are in the UI/UX field to make people's lives easier, more efficient, and effective. UX Storytelling helps us brainstorm, plan, and come up with better ideas as we begin to understand our users more accurately on a personal level. From extensive research, we are able to predict target users' responses more accurately by generating design ideas and building prototypes to test these ideas.
