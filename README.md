Today is one of those days where everything just seems more difficult and tiring.Knowing that his friends would have the time of their lives, while he would be working again made him feel left out. Music concerts are something that Sean really loves to go to and feels like he’s missing out, making him feel more lonely and frustrated. He feels like his social life is non-existent because most of the time when his friends ask him to hang out, he can’t because of work or internship. Since he can’t enjoy the concert tonight with his friends, he wanted to talk to other people who couldn’t make it to the concert to talk to. After Sean goes back home, he showers and hops on his bed. He opens the app where he would be able to talk to other people about music. He opens the app and goes to the Activity page that is represented by an icon on the bottom right. He saw his friends comment how excited they were to go to the concert on a post of the artist performing tonight. He goes to the artist page and looks at the Comments. Someone commented “Bummer! I can’t make it. Anyone else want to have a pity party with me?”  Curious, he clicks on her profile and decides to click “Add.” She accepts his request a few minutes later and taps “Message” bar under her profile picture. “Hey! I couldn’t make it to the show tonight either. Want to have a little pity party for ourselves?” She responded to this and they began to talk about their love for the artist performing tonight.
