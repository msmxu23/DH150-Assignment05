# Personas and Scenarios 
## Introduction 
 The purpose of UX Storytelling is so that we can understand how different users operate, especially our target users, so as UI/UX designers and researchers, we can build and create interfaces, systems, and products that cater to their liking. It is so that we know we are doing our best to make people's lives easier, more efficient, and effective. UX Storytelling helps us brainstorm, plan, and come up with better ideas as we begin to understand our users better.

I couldn’t make it to the show tonight either. Want to have a little pity party for ourselves?” She responded to this and they began to talk about their love for the artist performing tonight.
